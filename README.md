The optimal price is the price at which a seller can make the most profit. In other words, the price point at which the seller's total profit is maximized. We can refer to the optimal price as the profit maximizing price. The optimal price refers to both products and services.

Dynamic pricing is an e-commerce and retail strategy that applies variable pricing instead of the more typical fixed pricing. As more data is analyzed, optimal prices for items are calculated. The time between price changes depends upon the business and item, but can be as often as every day, or even every hour.
